# Traffic Monitoring in Bangladesh
Project Overview
In this project, you'll work with real-world traffic footage from Bangladesh to develop a YOLOv8-based object detection system. Your objective is to detect and classify multiple types of vehicles in traffic scenarios to support smarter urban mobility solutions.

By the end of this project, you'll be able to:

* Preprocess and analyze traffic video/image data
* Train a YOLOv8 object detection model to detect various vehicle types (e.g., cars, bikes, buses, trucks)
* Customize the YOLOv8 architecture and configure training parameters for optimal performance
* Implement model evaluation using precision, recall, mAP (mean Average Precision)
* Handle challenges like occlusion, crowded scenes, and small object detection
* Deploy the model to perform real-time inference on live or recorded traffic feeds

This project allows you to apply state-of-the-art object detection in a practical scenario, contributing toward intelligent traffic systems and smart city development in Bangladesh.
